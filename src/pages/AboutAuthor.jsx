          <p>
            Sahil Jeet Singh hails from the culturally rich city of Cuttack, Odisha.
            He began writing poems and short stories as a hobby, but his passion
            deepened while writing this story â€” his first novel.
          </p>

          {/* More personal context */}
          <p>
            Inspired by old-school romantic films and backed by his academic background
            in Sociology, Sahil brings a unique depth to themes like love, family,
            and emotion. This novel is his tribute to all those who love wholeheartedly
            and selflessly.
